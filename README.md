An attempt at creating a well performing dwarf fortress clone in C#. 
It is designed to be multithreaded from the get-go to prevent major rewrites due to performance bottlenecks. 

There are two solutions, one for the main project, and the other as a base mod.
The modding structure is inspired by Bethesda Game Studios and their awesome games.
